# Roadmap

## Functionalities

* Multiple targets.
* Clicking outside of toggle deactivates it (optional).
* When a toggle is activated its triggers get updates as well.
* Listen to hash-changes (optional).
* Group toggles together for functionality like tabs, accordions etc.
* Allow inputs to be triggers (e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes, select).
* A "Collapse" child class which inherits the main Toggle logic, but adds height/width measurements to allow CSS animation.

## Ideas

* Use ARIA-states instead of classes?
* Only allow anchors/buttons to be triggers?
* Set tabindex automatically on triggers?
